# **Hey I'm Daniel! ‚úåÔ∏è**

### **About Me**
I'm a third year computer science and technology student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I have a keen interest in cloud computing and devops, to get to this goal firstly I have obtained the title of AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. I try to keep on learning about these two areas and am constantly looking for ways to learn more about these and obtain certifications to be able to get to those job positions that I've always aspired to obtain.
